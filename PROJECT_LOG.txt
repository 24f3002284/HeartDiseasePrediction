MODEL ARCHITECTURE DETAILS

Layer Structure:
  Input Layer:   13 features
  Hidden Layer 1: 256 units → BatchNorm → ReLU → Dropout(0.3)
  Hidden Layer 2: 128 units → BatchNorm → ReLU → Dropout(0.3)
  Hidden Layer 3: 64 units  → BatchNorm → ReLU → Dropout(0.2)
  Output Layer:   1 unit    → Sigmoid

Total Parameters: ~52,000

Optimizer: Adam
  - Initial Learning Rate: 0.005
  - Dynamic LR reduction on plateau

Loss Function: Binary Cross-Entropy

1. BatchNormalization
   - Normalizes layer inputs for faster convergence
   - Reduces internal covariate shift
   - Enables higher learning rates

2. Dropout Regularization
   - Prevents overfitting to training data
   - Rates: 0.3 for first two layers, 0.2 for third layer
   - Improves model generalization

3. Early Stopping
   - Monitors validation loss
   - Stops training when no improvement for 4 epochs
   - Automatically restores best weights
   - Prevents wasted training time

4. Learning Rate Scheduling
   - Reduces LR by 50% when validation plateaus
   - Patience: 2 epochs
   - Minimum LR: 1e-5
   - Helps find better optima

5. Class Weight Balancing
   - Automatically computes balanced weights
   - Handles any class imbalance
   - Ensures fair treatment of both classes

6. Higher Initial Learning Rate
   - 0.005 instead of typical 0.001
   - Enables faster convergence
   - Works well with BatchNormalization
